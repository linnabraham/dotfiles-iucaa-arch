# Dotfiles

This is the system configuration for my office machine.

- I have a set of custom [scripts](https://github.com/linnabraham/useful-scripts) that I use for various purposes.
- I have a custom set of [snippets](https://github.com/linnabraham/my-snippets) that I use with the [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) plugin in ViM.
- I have custom [cheatsheets](https://github.com/linnabraham/cheatsheets) that I use with the [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat) program on Linux.
- I have my set of academic [notes](https://github.com/linnabraham/notes) made on various topics using the [TexNotes](https://github.com/linnabraham/TeXNotes) setup.
- These dotfiles are managed using [yadm](https://github.com/yadm-dev/yadm).
- I also keep the dotfiles for my [laptop](https://github.com/linnabraham/dotfiles-primary).
- I have a custom work [planner and task-management tool](https://github.com/linnabraham/work-journal) for planning my daily work and managing tasks, written using `bash` and `LaTeX`.
## Software Recommendations
- I use [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for a variety of purposes.
    - Storing all of my academic textbooks and research reading on the cloud using WebDAV.
    - This allows me to make use of the Zotero mobile application which is currently in beta.
    - Storing annotations on all the pdfs and epubs separately of the files themselves.
    - Storing all of my non-academic reading as well.
    - Storing and annotating articles that I read on the web.
    - As a reference management tool.
- I collect, tag and organize all of the music that I listen to. 
    - On desktop I use [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) for playing the music, which is a daemon - along with the [plattenalbum](https://github.com/SoongNoonien/plattenalbum) client.
    - I push this to the cloud using [iBroadcast](https://www.ibroadcast.com/home/).
- I keep backups of all my data on my personal laptop by leveraging the [BTRFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Btrfs) filesystem's snapshotting feature and using the [snapper](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper) client. I transfer the monthly backups to an external device.
- I use the [buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku) software for keeping and organizing bookmarks.
- I use the [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) software for my password management.
- I use the [khal](https://github.com/pimutils/khal) calendar software along with the [vdirsyncer](https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer) utility for syncing my local calendar with google calendar.
- I use [lf](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lf) as my terminal file manager on Linux which lets me go without a graphical file manager as far as possible.
